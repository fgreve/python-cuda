This directory contains Python bindings for CUDA, both the Application API
and the Runtime API. It also provides bindings for CUBLAS and CUFFT.
The support for CUBLAS is incomplete, complex BLAS routines are missing.
In the examples directory are several test example, some translated
from CUDA SDK examples, some self-written.

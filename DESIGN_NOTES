SUGAR:

kernel execution:
    driver:
        1. compile the code if not already cached (same as pycuda)
        2. returns a string either to the entire cubin or a function in the cubin

    runtime:
        1. compile the code into shared library if not already cached (very similar but not quite the same as pycuda)
        2. returns a callable factory representing the kernel function.

numpy/cuda memory: 
    xxx.ref is device ptr
    page-locked flag?
    
    Composed of the following classes:
    0. baseCudaNumpyArray (abstract class subclassing ndarray)
    (these subclass baseCudaNumpyArray) 
    1. CublasNumpyArray 
    2. CufftNumpyArray
    3. CudaLinearNumpyArray
    
error checking:
    error checking works by passing the cuda function and its args to a wrapper function which checks for cuda errors:

    sugar.check_error(func, **args)


automatic ctypes'ing:
    1. script to automate h2xml + xml2py (done by Justin: cuda/utils/createbindings.py)
    2. automatic replacement of hardcoded references to shared libs (/path/to/libxxx.so) with calls to libutils.get_lib (TODO)
       using sed on a pipe ?
